For our project we implemented fully homomorphic encryption, using the scheme
described in class and in lecture notes, using the Sage open-source mathematics
framework.

\section{Results}

We implemented a proof-of-concept NAND gate, since it is functionally complete.
The implementation is highly inefficient and features no alebraic
optimizations; our proof-of-concept takes approximately twenty minutes to
compute an encrypted NAND over two bits with the following parameters: $n=4$,
$q=64$, $Q=2^{25}$, and $\Beta=1$ (i.e. keys $s\in \mathbb{Z}_{64}^4$ and
$z\in\mathbb{Z}_{2^{25}}^4$). These are the smallest parameters for which we
can compute a NAND gate with error $\Beta > 0$. To validate the gate, we
computed an encrypted NAND over two randomly generated bits and compared the
the decrypted output with the expected output. Decryption was successful across
twenty independent trials. The the trials are meaningful; with increased error
the test reports both positive and negative results.

\section{Parameter Tuning}

% add smallest found parameters for beta=1 and n=8 with decryption and key switching
% add estimation of time for caculating nand operation on nand gates.

\begin{tabular}{r   l}
\textbf{Operation} & \textbf{Time} \\
\hline
decomposition & 39.8ms \\
matrix multiplication & 7.8ms \\
\end{tabular}


\section{Performance Optimizations}
The majority of time spent by our code is used in the computing the decomposition of
matrix. Our attempts to improve performance by computing the function on low level
matricies proved to be inefficient as it took too long to convert between these
matricies and those used by SAGE. In the end, we settled on using a compiled version
of our decompose function operating on the SAGE matrix after preallocating the space
used by the matrix.

The other significant optimization was in, \texttt{hLstAdd}, the function for computing the convolutions used in homomorphic decryption. Instead of recomputing the decompositions for each homomorphic multiplication, we precompute the decompositions in order to reduce the number of decompositions needed by a factor of $q$.
